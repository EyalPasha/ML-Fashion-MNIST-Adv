# ML-Fashion-MNIST-Adv

This project presents an advanced image classification model trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset using Keras. It explores various deep learning techniques to enhance model performance and accuracy.

## Overview

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset comprising 70,000 grayscale images of fashion products from 10 categories, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is 28x28 pixels. This dataset serves as a more challenging alternative to the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

## Project Structure

- **f_2ipynb.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the Keras model, training process, and evaluation.

## Features

- Implementation of a deep learning model using Keras.
- Training and evaluation on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
- Visualization of training metrics.

Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image, and the dataset includes the following classes:îˆ†
